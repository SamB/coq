			CoqIde Installation procedure.

CoqIde is a graphical interface to perform interactive proofs.
You should be able to do everything you do in coqtop inside CoqIde 
excepted dropping to the ml toplevel.

DISCLAIMER: CoqIde is ongoing work. Eventhough it should never let you
	    loose a proof, you may encounter unexpected bugs.
 	    Do not hesitate to send suggestions/bug reports.

REQUIREMENT:
	- make world must succeed.
	- The graphical toolkit Gtk 2.x. See http://www.gtk.org.
	  The official supported version is at least 2.2.x.
	  You may still compile CoqIde with older 2.0.x versions and 
          use all features.
	  Run 
		"pkg-config --modversion gtk+-2.0"
	  to check your version.
	 All recent distributions have precompiled packages.
	 Do not forget to install the developement headers packages.
	 As for Debian/woody, 
		apt-get install libgtk2.0-dev 
	 should be enough.

INSTALLATION
 1) You need to install the OCaml stub library lablgtk2. See 
       		http://wwwfun.kurims.kyoto-u.ac.jp/soft/olabl/lablgtk.html
	  The official snapshot are not yet ready for CoqIde.
	  Use this one :
		http://www.lix.polytechnique.fr/~monate/download/lablgtk2.tgz
    If you are in a hurry just run :
    
    cd /tmp && \
    wget http://www.lix.polytechnique.fr/~monate/download/lablgtk2.tgz && \
    tar zxvf lablgtk2.tgz && \
    cd lablgtk2 && \
    make configure && \
    make all opt && \
    make install

   You must have write access to the OCaml standard library path.
   If this fails read lablgtk2/README.

2) Go into your Coq source directory and then : 

   make ide

3) You may now run bin/coqide.opt or bin/coqide.byte.

NOTES
Font configuration is not saved.
If you want to change the defaults fonts, just copy the
.coqiderc file located in the ide subdir of the Coq library to
your home directory and edit it by hand.

(* R. Diaconescu [Diaconescu] showed that the Axiom of Choice in Set Theory
   entails Excluded-Middle; S. Lacas and B. Werner [LacasWerner]
   adapted the proof to show that the axiom of choice in equivalence
   classes entails Excluded-Middle in Type Theory.

   This is an adaptatation of the proof by Hugo Herbelin to show that
   the relational form of the Axiom of Choice + Extensionality for
   predicates entails Excluded-Middle

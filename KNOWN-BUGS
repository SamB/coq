  THIS IS A LIST OF KNOWN BUGS OF COQ V7.0 BETA

- The syntax "Specialize num ident" is temporarily not accepted
  outside "Tactic Definition". Syntax "Specialize ident" is OK.

- Realizer and Program/Program_all are not available

- No consistency check is done when requiring a module (that is, a
  module can be compiled with logical name Mycontrib.Arith.Plus but
  required with name HisContrib.Zarith.Plus).

- Real numbers not subterm of a complex expression are written under a
  form like ``4+1`` instead of ``5``.

- Local definitions in Record/Structure are not allowed

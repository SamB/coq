This work was done for the RNRT Project Calife. 
As such it is distributed under the LGPL licence.

Change the COQTOP variable in the Makefile and type make. 
The caml compiler should be in your path.

WARNING : there is a bug in the 7.0 production release that prevents
the compilation of the core ReflOmegaCore.v module. This development
will only work with the beta release and (hopefully) subsequent version
of Coq.

A patch (patch-v7) contributed by D. Delahaye is included to correct the bug in
regular 7.0 versions. It must be applied in the 'parsing' directory.
Using it with a 7.0beta requires a few changes in const_omega.ml due to
some changes in the paths of modules.

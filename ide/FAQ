Q1) How to enable Emacs keybindings?
R1: Insert 
	gtk-key-theme-name = "Emacs"
    in your ".coqiderc" file. It may be in the current dir
    or in $HOME dir.

Q2) How to change the default font ?
R2) Insert 
	style "default" {
	font_name = "Monospace 14"
	}
	class "GtkTextView" style "default"
    in your .coqiderc file. See Q1.
    You may replace Monospace 14 by anything reasonable describing 
    a font. For example "Sans bold 22". See Pango Font Descriptions for more
    informations (http://www.pango.org/).

Q3) How to enable antialiased fonts?
R3) Set the GDK_USE_XFT variable to 1.

Q4) How can use Forall and Exists pretty symbols ?
R4) Thanks to the Notation features in Coq, you just need to insert these
	lines in your Coq Buffer :
======================================================================
Notation "∀ x : t | P" := (x:t)P (at level 1, x,t,P at level 10).
Notation "∃ x : t | P" := (EXT x:t|P) (at level 1, x,t,P at level 10).
======================================================================
Copy/Paste might not work. You need to load a file containing these lines or to enter 
the "∀" using an input method. As a convenience, you may put these lines in
a utf8.v file and start coqide with : 
	coqide -l utf8.v


Input Methods:
-First solution : type "<CONTROL><SHIFT>2200" to enter a forall in the script widow. 
	2200 is the hexadecimal code for forall in unicode charts and is encoded as "∀"	
	in UTF-8.
	2203 is for exists. See http://www.unicode.org for more.
-Second solution : rebind "<AltGr>a" to forall and "<AltGr>e" to exists. Under X11, you need to 
	use something like
		xmodmap -e "keycode  24 = a A F13 F13" 
		xmodmap -e "keycode  26 = e E F14 F14" 
	and then to add   
		bind "F13" {"insert-at-cursor" ("∀")}
		bind "F14" {"insert-at-cursor" ("∃")}
	to your "binding "text"" section in .coqiderc. 
	The strange ("∀") argument is the UTF-8 encoding for
	0x2200. It is computed by lablgtk2 by 
		Glib.Utf8.from_unichar 0x2200;;
	Further symbols can be bound on higher Fxx key symbols.

<H1>The Coq Standard Library</H1>

<p>Here is a short description of the Coq standard library, which is
distributed with the system.
It provides a set of modules directly available 
through the <tt>Require Import</tt> command.</p>

<p>The standard library is composed of the following subdirectories:</p>

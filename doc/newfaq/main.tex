\section{Introduction}
This FAQ is the sum of the questions that came to mind as we developed
proofs in \Coq. Since we are singularly short-minded, we wrote the
answers we found on bits of papers to have them at hand whenever the
situation occurs again. This, is pretty much the result of that: a
collection of tips one can refer to when proofs become intricate. Yes,
this means we won't take the blame for the shortcomings of this
FAQ. But if you want to contribute and send in your own question and
answers, feel free to write to us\ldots

\section{Presentation}

\Question[whatiscoq]{What is \Coq ?} 
The Coq tool is a proof assistant which:
\begin{itemize}
\item allows to handle calculus assertions,
\item to check mechanically proofs of these assertions,
\item helps to find formal proofs,
\item extracts a certified program from the constructive proof of its formal specification, 
\end{itemize}
Coq is written in the Objective Caml language and uses 
the Camlp4 Pre-processor-pretty-printer for Objective Caml.

\Question[name]{Did you really need to name it like that ?}
Some French computer scientists have a tradition of naming their
software as animal species: Caml, Elan, Foc or Krakatoa are examples
of this tacit convention. In French, ``coq'' means rooster, and it
sounds like the initials of the Calculus of Constructions CoC on which
it is based.

\Question[theoremprovers]{What are the other theorem provers ?} 
Many other theorem provers are available for use nowadays. Isabelle /
HOL, Lego, Nuprl, PVS are examples of provers that are fairly similar
to \Coq by the way they interact with the user. More distant relatives of
\Coq are ACL2, ALF, Alfa, Mizar, $\Omega$mega\ldots


\Question[intuitionnisticlogic]{What is intuitionnistic logic ?}

This is any logic which does not assume that ``A or not A''.


\Question[theory]{Where can I find information about the theory behind \Coq ?}

\begin{description}
\item[Type theory] A book~\cite{ProofsTypes}, some lecture
notes~\cite{Types:Dowek} and the \Coq manual~\cite{Coq:manual}
\item[Inductive types]
Christine Paulin-Mohring's habilitation thesis~\cite{Pau96b}
\item[Co-Inductive types]
Eduardo Giménez' thesis~\cite{EGThese}
\end{description}


\Question[provingprograms]{How can I use \Coq to prove programs ?}

You can either extract a program from a proof use the extraction
mechanism or use dedicated tools, such as \Why and \Krakatoa, to prove
annotated programs written in other languages.

\Question[nbusers]{How many \Coq users are there ?}

That's a good question.

\Question[howold]{How old is \Coq ?}
The first official release of \Coq (v. 4.1.0) was distributed in 1989.

\Question[relatedtools]{What are the \Coq-related tools ?}

\begin{description}
\item[Coqide] A GTK based gui for \Coq.
\item[Pcoq] A gui for \Coq with proof by pointing and pretty printing.
\item[Why] A back-end generator of verification conditions.
\item[Krakatoa] A Java code certification tool that uses both \Coq and \Why to verify the soundness of implementations with regards to the specifications.
\item[coqwc] A tool similar to {\tt wc} to count lines in \Coq files.
\item[coq-tex] A tool to insert \Coq examples within .tex files. 
\item[coqdoc] A documentation tool for \Coq.
\item[Proof General] A emacs mode for \Coq and many other proof assistants.
\item[Foc] The Foc project aims at building an environment to develop certified computer algebra libraries. 
\end{description}

\Question[industrial]{What are industrial application for \Coq ?}

Coq is used by Trusted Logic to prove properties of the JavaCard system.

\subsection{My goal is ...,  how can I prove it ?}


\Question[conjonction]{My goal is a conjunction, how can I prove it ?}

Use some theorem or assumption or use the \split tactic.
\begin{coq_example}
Goal forall A B:Prop, A->B-> A/\B.
intros.
split.
assumption.
assumption.
Qed.
\end{coq_example}

\Question[conjonctionhyp]{My goal contains a conjunction as an hypothesis, how can I use it ?}

If you want to decompose your hypothesis into other hypothesis you can use the \decompose tactic :

\begin{coq_example}
Goal forall A B:Prop, A/\B-> B.
intros.
decompose [and] H.
assumption.
Qed.
\end{coq_example}


\Question[disjonction]{My goal is a disjonction, how can I prove it ?}

You can prove the left part or the right part of the disjunction using
\left or \right tactics. If you want to do a classical
reasoning step, use {\tt } to prove the right part with the assumption
that the left part of the disjunction is false.

\begin{coq_example}
Goal forall A B:Prop, A-> A\/B.
intros.

assumption.
Qed.
\end{coq_example}


\Question[forall]{My goal is an universally quantified statement, how can I prove it ?}

Use some theorem or assumption or introduce the quantified variable in
the context using the \intro tactic. If there are several
variables you can use the \intros tactic. A good habit is to
provide names for these variables: \Coq will do it anyway, but such
automatic naming decreases readability and robustness.




\Question[exist]{My goal is an existential, how can I prove it ?}

Use some theorem or assumption or exhibit the witness using the \exists tactic.
\begin{coq_example}
Goal exists x:nat, forall y, x+y=y.

Just use the \ring tactic.

\begin{coq_example}
Require Import ZArith.
Require Ring.
Open Local Scope Z_scope.
Goal forall a b : Z, (a+b)*(a+b) = a*a + 2*a*b + b*b. 
intros.
ring.
Qed.
\end{coq_example}

\Question[field]{My goal is an equality on some field (e.g. reals), how can I prove it ?}

Just use the \field tactic.

\begin{coq_example}
Require Import Reals.
Require Ring.
Open Local Scope R_scope.
Goal forall a b : R, b*a<>0 -> (a/b) * (b/a) = 1. 
intros.
field.
assumption.
Qed.
\end{coq_example}


\Question[omega]{My goal is an inequality on R, how can I prove it ?}

You need the \gb tactic.

\Question[apply]{My goal is solvable by  some lemma, how can I prove it ?}

Just use the \apply tactic.

\begin{coq_eval}
Reset Initial.
\end{coq_eval}

\begin{coq_example}
Lemma mylemma : forall x, x+0 = x.
auto.
Qed.

Goal 3+0 = 3.
apply mylemma.
Qed.
\end{coq_example}

\Question[falseimpliesall]{My goal contains False as an hypotheses, how can I prove it ?}

\end{coq_example}


\Question[letgoal]{My goal is a {\tt let}, how can I prove it ?}

Just use the \destruct or \case tactics.


\Question[existentialhyp]{My goal contains some existancial hypotheses, how can I use it ?}

You can use the tactic \elim with you hypotheses as an argument.

\Question[existentialhypdecomp]{My goal contains some existancial hypotheses, how can I use it and decompose my knowledge about this new thing into different hypotheses ?}

\begin{verbatim}
Ltac DecompEx H P := elim H;intro P;intro TO;decompose [and] TO;clear TO;clear H.
\end{verbatim}


\Question[symmetry]{My goal is an equality, how can I swap the left and right hand terms ?}

Just use the \symmetry tactic.
%\begin{coq_example}
%Goal forall x y : nat, x=y -> y=x.
%intros.
%symmetry.
%assumption.
%Qed.
%\end{coq_example}


\Question[transitivity]{My goal is an equality, how can I prove it by transitivity ?}

Just use the \transitivity tactic.
\begin{coq_example}
Goal forall x y z : nat, x=y -> y=z -> x=z.
intros.
transitivity y.
assumption.
assumption.
Qed.
\end{coq_example}


\Question[eapplyeauto]{My goal would be solvable using {\tt apply;assumption} if It would not create meta-variables, how can I prove it ?}

You can use {\tt eapply yourtheorem;eauto} but it won't work in all cases ! (for example if more than one hypotheses match one of the sub goals generated by \eapply) so you should rather use  {\tt try solve [eapply yourtheorem;eauto]}, otherwise some metavariables may be incorrectly instanciated.

\begin{coq_example}
Lemma trans : forall x y z : nat, x=y -> y=z -> x=z.
intros.
transitivity y;assumption.
Qed.

Goal forall x y z : nat, x=y -> y=z -> x=z.
intros.
eapply trans;eauto.
Qed.

Goal forall x y z t : nat, x=y -> x=t -> y=z -> x=z.
intros.
eapply trans;eauto.
Undo.
eapply trans.
apply H.
auto.
Qed.

Goal forall x y z t : nat, x=y -> x=t -> y=z -> x=z.
intros.
eapply trans;eauto.
Undo.
try solve [eapply trans;eauto].
eapply trans.
apply H.
auto.
Qed.

\end{coq_example}

\Question[autowith]{My goal is solvable by  some lemma within a set of lemmas and I don't want to remember which one, how can I prove it ?}

You can use a what is called a ``base of Hints''.

\begin{coq_example}
Require Import ZArith.
Require Ring.
Open Local Scope Z_scope.

Lemma toto1 : 1+1 = 2.
ring.
Qed.

Lemma toto2 : 2+2 = 4.
ring.
Qed.

Lemma toto3 : 2+1 = 3.
ring.
Qed.

Hint Resolve toto1 toto2 toto3 : mybase.

Goal 2+(1+1)=4. 
auto with mybase.
Qed.
\end{coq_example}


\Question[savedqed]{What is the difference between saved qed and defined ?}

\Question[opaquetrans]{What is the difference between opaque and transparent ?}


\Question[assumption]{My goal is one of the hypothesis, how can I prove it ?}

Use the \assumption tactic.

\begin{coq_example}
Goal 1=1 -> 1=1.
intro.
assumption.
Qed.
\end{coq_example}


\Question[assumption2]{My goal is more than one of the hypothesis and I want to chose which one is used, how can I do it ?}

Use the \exact tactic.
\begin{coq_example}
Goal 1=1 -> 1=1 -> 1=1.
intros.
exact H0.
Qed.
\end{coq_example}

\Question[assumption2bis]{What can be the difference between applying one hypotheses or another in the context of the last question ?}

From a proof point of view it is equivalent but if you want to extract a program from your proof, the two hyphoteses can lead to different programs.


\Question[trivial]{My goal is ???, how can I prove it ?}

\Question[rewrite]{I want to replace some term with another in the goal, how can I do it ?}

If one of your hypothesis (say {\tt H}) states that the terms are equals you can use the \rewrite tactic. Otherwise you can use the \replace {\tt with} tactic. 

\Question[rewrite2]{I want to replace some term with another in the hypothesis, how can I do it ?}

You can use the \rewrite {\tt in} tactic.

\Question[unfold]{I want to replace some symbol with its definition, how can I do it ?}

You can use the \unfold tactic.


\Question[simpl]{How can I reduce some term ?}

You can use the \simpl tactic.

\Question[pose]{How can I pose some term ?}

You can use the \set or \pose tactics.

\Question[case]{How can I perform case analysis ?}

You can use the \case or \destruct tactics.


\Question[namedintros]{Why should I name my intros ?}

When you use the \intro tactic you don't have to give a name to your
hypothesis. If you do so the names will be generated by \Coq but your
scripts won't be modular. If you add some hypothesis to your theorem
(or change their order), you will have to change your proof to adapt
to the new names.

\Question[namedintrosbis]{How can I automatize that ?}

You can use the {\tt Show Intro.} command to generate the names and use your editor to generate a fully named \intro tactic. 

\Question[assert]{I want to state a fact that I will use later as an hypothesis, how can I do it ?}

If you want to use forward reasoning (first proving the fact and then
using it) You just need to use the \assert tactic. If you want to use
backward reasoning (proving your goal using an assumption and then
proving the assumption) use the \cut tactic.

\Question[assertback]{I want to state a fact that I will use later as an hypothesis and prove it later, how can I do it ?}

You can use \elim followed by \intro or you can use the following \Ltac command :
\begin{verbatim}
Ltac assert_later t := cut t;[intro|idtac]. 
\end{verbatim}


\Question[proofwith]{I want to automatize the use of some tactic how can I do it ?}

You need to use the {\tt proof with T} command and add \ldots at the
end of your sentences.

For instance :
\begin{coq_example}
Goal forall A B C : Prop, A -> B/\C -> A/\B/\C.
Proof with assumption.
intros.
split...
Qed.
\end{coq_example}


\Question[solve]{I want to execute the proofwith tactic only if it solves the goal, how can I do it ?}

You need to use the \solve tactic.
For instance :
\begin{coq_example}
Require Import ZArith.
Require Ring.
Open Local Scope Z_scope.
Goal forall a b c : Z, c=0 -> c=0.
Proof with solve [ring].
intros.
auto.
Qed.
\end{coq_example}



\Question[subgoalsorder]{How can I change the order of the subgoals ?}

You can use the \Focus command to concentrate on some goal. When the goal is proved you will see the remaining goals.


\Question[hyphotesisorder]{How can I change the order of the hypothesis ?}

You can use the {\tt move ... after} command.

\Question[hyphotesisname]{How can I change the name of an hypothesis ?}

You can use the {\tt rename ... into} command.

\Question[generalize]{How can I do the opposite of the \intro tactic ?}

You can use the \generalize tactic.


\Question[applyerror]{What can I do if I get {\tt generated subgoal term' has metavariables in it } ?}

You should use the \eapply tactic.


\Question[ifsyntax]{What is the syntax for if ?}

\Question[letsyntax]{What is the syntax for let ?}

\Question[patternmatchingsyntax]{What is the syntax for pattern matching ?}


\Question[abstract]{What can I do when {\tt Qed.} is slow ?}

Sometime you can use the \abstractt tactic, which makes as if you had
stated one intermediated lemmas, this speeds up the typing process.

\Question[admitted]{How can use a proof which is not finished ?}

You can use the {\tt Admitted} command to state your current proof as an axiom.

\Question[conjecture]{How can I state a conjecture ?}

You can use the {\tt Admitted} command to state your current proof as an axiom.

\Question[twodiffconstr]{How to prove that two constructor are different ?}

You can use the \discriminate tactic.



\Question[coqccoqtop]{What is the difference between coqc et coqtop ?}

\Question[coqerror]{Do you know a coq-error-to-english translator ?}

\subsection{\Ltac}

\Question[ltac]{What is \Ltac ?}

\Ltac is the tactic language for \Coq. It provides the user with a
high-level ``toolbox'' for tactic creation.

\Question[ltacerror]{Why do I always get the same error message ?}


\Question[ltacprint]{Is there any printing command in \Ltac ?}

You can use the \idtac tactic with a string argument. This string
will be printed out. The same applies to the \fail tactic

\Question[letltac]{What is the syntax for let in \Ltac ?}

If $x_i$ are identifiers and $e_i$ and $expr$ are tactic expressions, then let reads:
\begin{center}
{\tt let $x_1$:=$e_1$ with $x_2$:=$e_2$\ldots with $x_n$:=$e_n$ in
$expr$}.
\end{center}
Beware that if $expr$ is complex (i.e. features at least a sequence) parenthesis
should be added around it. For example: 
\begin{coq_example}
Ltac twoIntro := let x:=intro in (x;x).
\end{coq_example}

\Question[matchltac]{What is the syntax for pattern matching in \Ltac ?}

Pattern matching on a term $expr$ (non-linear first order unification)
with patterns $p_i$ and tactic expressions $e_i$ reads:
\begin{center}
\hspace{10ex}
{\tt match $expr$ with
\hspace*{2ex}$p_1$ => $e_1$
\hspace*{1ex}\textbar$p_2$ => $e_2$
\hspace*{1ex}\ldots
\hspace*{1ex}\textbar$p_n$ => $e_n$
\hspace*{1ex}\textbar\ \textunderscore\ => $e_{n+1}$
end.
}
\end{center}
Underscore matches all terms.

\Question[matchsem]{What is the semantics for match goal ?}

{\tt match goal} matches the current goal against a series of
patterns: {$hyp_1 \ldots hyp_n$ \textbar- $ccl$}. It uses a
first-order unification algorithm, and tries all the possible
combinations of $hyp_i$ before dropping the branch and moving to the
next one. Underscore matches all terms.

\Question[fresh]{How can I generate a new name ?}

You can use the following syntax :
{\tt Let id:=fresh in \ldots}\\
For example :
\begin{coq_example}
Ltac introIdGen := let id:=fresh in intro id.
\end{coq_example}

\Question[typeof]{How can I acces the type of a term ?}


\Question[statdyn]{How can I define static and dynamic code ?}

\Question[apttmatchdep]{Is there anyway to do pattern matching with dependant types ?}

\Question[secondorderunif]{What can I do if I get ``Cannot solve a second-order unification problem'' ?}

\Question[tacticcontent]{How can I know what does a tactic ?}

\Question[autodepth]{Why auto does not work ? How can I fix it ?}

You can increase the depth of the proof search or add some lemmas in the base of hints.

\Question[pattern]{What is the use of the pattern tactic ?}

\Question[assertcut]{What is the difference between assert, cut and generalize ?}

PS: Notice for people that are interested in proof rendering that Assert
and Pose (and Cut) are not rendered the same as Generalize (see the
HELM experimental rendering tool at http://mowgli.cs.unibo.it, link
HELM, link COQ Online). Indeed Generalize builds a beta-expanded term
while Assert, Pose and Cut uses a let-in.

\begin{verbatim}
  (* Goal is T *)
  Generalize (H1 H2).
  (* Goal is A->T *)
  ... a proof of A->T ...
\end{verbatim}

is rendered into something like
\begin{verbatim}
  (h) ... the proof of A->T ...
      we proved A->T
  (h0) by (H1 H2) we proved A
  by (h h0) we proved T
\end{verbatim}
while 
\begin{verbatim}
  (* Goal is T *)
  Assert q := (H1 H2).
  (* Goal is A *)
  ... a proof of A ...
  (* Goal is A |- T *)
  ... a proof of T ...
\end{verbatim}
is rendered into something like
\begin{verbatim}
  (q) ... the proof of A ...
      we proved A
  ... the proof of T ...
  we proved T
\end{verbatim}
Otherwise said, Generalize is not rendered in a forward-reasoning way,
while Assert is.

\Question[vector]{How can I define vectors of size n ?}

\Question[autospeed]{How can I speed up \auto ?}

You can use info \auto to replace \auto by the tactics it generates.
You can split your hint bases into smaller ones.

\Question[evaluable]{Can you explain me what an evaluable constant is ?}

\Question[Tauto]{What is the equivalent of Tauto for classical logic ?}

Currently there are no equivalent tactic for classical logic.

\subsection{Glossary}

\Question[goal]{What is a goal ?}

The goal is the statement to be proved.

\Question[metavariable]{What is a meta variable ?}

A meta variable in \Coq represents a ``hole'', i.e. a part of a proof
that is still unknown. 

\Question[constr]{What is a constr ?}

\Question[gallina]{What is Gallina ?}

\Question[command]{What is a command ?}

\Question[lemmasvstheorem]{What is difference between a lemma, a fact  and a theorem ?}

\Question[organize]{How can I organize my proofs ?}

\Question[dependanttype]{What is a dependent type ?}


\Question[reflection]{What is a proof by reflection ?}

This is a proof generated by some computation which is done using the
internal reduction of \Coq (not using the tactic language of \Coq
(\Ltac) nor the implementation language for \Coq).  An example of
tactic using the reflection mechanism is the \ring tactic. The
reflection method consist in reflecting a subset of \Coq language (for
example the arithmetical expressions) into an object of the \Coq
language itself (in this case an inductive type denoting arithmetical
expressions).  For more information see~\cite{howe,harrison,boutin}
and the last chapter of the Coq'Art.


\Question[irrelevance]{What is proof-irrelevance ?}


\section{Publishing tools}

\Question[coqlatex]{How can I generate some latex from my development ?}

You can use {\tt coqdoc}.

\Question[coqhtml]{How can I generate some HTML from my development ?}

You can use {\tt coqdoc}.

\Question[depgraph]{How can I generate some dependency graph from my development ?}



\Question[coqtex]{How can I cite some \Coq in my latex document ?}

You can use {\tt coq\_tex}.

\section{CoqIde}

\Question[coqidedescr]{What is \CoqIde ?}

\CoqIde is a gtk based gui for \Coq.

\section{Extraction}

\Question[extraction]{What is program extraction ?}

Program extraction consist in generating a program from a constructive proof.

\Question[extraclang]{Which language can I extract to ?}

You can extract your programs to Objective Caml and Haskell.

\Question[extraaxiom]{How can I change extract an incomplete proof ?}

You can provide programs for your axioms.


\section{Conclusion and Farewell.}
\label{ccl}

\Question[NoAns]{What if my question isn't answered here ?} 
\label{lastquestion}

Don't panic. You can try the \Coq manual~\cite{Coq:manual} for a technical
description of the prover. The Coq'Art~\cite{Coq:coqart} is the first
book written on \Coq and provides a comprehensive review of the
theorem prover as well as a number of example and exercises. Finally,
the tutorial~\cite{Coq:Tutorial} provides a smooth introduction to
theorem proving in \Coq.

\begin{abstract}
This note intends to provide an easy way to get aquainted with the
\Coq theorem prover. It tries to formulate appropriate answers
to some of the questions any newcommers will face, and to give
pointers to other references when possible.

\Question[NoAns]{What if my question isn't answered here ?} 
\label{lastquestion}

Don't panic. You can try the \Coq manual~\cite{Coq:e} for a technical
description of the prover. The Coq'Art~\cite{Coq:coqart} is the first
book written on \Coq and provides a comprehensive review of the
theorem prover as well as a number of example and exercises. Finally,
the tutorial~\cite{Coq:Tutorial} provides a smooth introduction to
theorem proving in \Coq.

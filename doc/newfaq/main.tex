This note intends to provide an easy way to get aquainted with the
\Coq theorem prover. It tries to formulate appropriate answers
to some of the questions any newcommers will face, and to give
pointers to other references when possible.

\section{Introduction}
This FAQ is the sum of the questions that came to mind as we developed
proofs in \Coq. Since we are singularly short-minded, we wrote the
answers we found on bits of papers to have them at hand whenever the
situation occurs again. This, is pretty much the result of that: a
collection of tips one can refer to when proofs become intricate. Yes,
this means we won't take the blame for the shortcomings of this
FAQ. But if you want to contribute and send in your own question and
answers, feel free to write to us\ldots

\section{Presentation}

\Question[whatiscoq]{What is \Coq ?} 
The Coq tool is a proof assistant which:
\begin{itemize}
\item allows to handle calculus assertions,
\item to check mechanically proofs of these assertions,
\item helps to find formal proofs,
\item extracts a certified program from the constructive proof of its formal specification, 
\end{itemize}
Coq is written in the Objective Caml language and uses the Camlp4 Pre-processor-pretty-printer for Objective Caml.

\Question[name]{Did you really need to name it like that ?}
Some french computer scientists have a tradition of naming their
software as animal species: Caml, Elan, Foc or Krakatoa are examples
of this tacit convention. In french, ``coq'' means rooster, and it
sounds like the initials of the Calculus of Constructions CoC on which
it is based.

\Question[theoremprovers]{What are the other theorem provers ?} 
Many other theorem provers are available for use nowadays. Isabelle /
HOL, Lego, Nuprl, PVS are examples of provers that are fairly similar
to \Coq by the way they interact with the user. More distant relatives of
\Coq are ACL2, ALF, Alfa, Mizar, $\Omega$mega\ldots


\Question[intuitionnisticlogic]{What is intuitionnistic logic ?}

This is any logic which does not assume that ``A or not A''.


\Question[theory]{Where can I find informations about the theory behind \Coq ?}

be published by Springer-Verlag in 2004:

``This book provides a pragmatic introduction to the development of
proofs and certified programs using Coq. With its large collection of
examples and exercises it is an invaluable tool for researchers,
students, and engineers interested in formal methods and the
development of zero-default software.''

\section{Talkin' with the Rooster}

\Question[coqexamples]{Where can I find some \Coq examples ?} 

There are examples in the manual and in the CoqArt. You can find large developments using \Coq in the \Coq contributions : {\tt http://coq.inria.fr/distrib-eng.html}


\Question[goal]{What is a goal ?}

The goal is the statement to be proved.

\Question[metavariable]{What is a meta variable ?}

\Question[type]{What is Type(i) ?}

\Question[dependanttype]{What is a dependent type ?}

\Question[conjonction]{My goal is a conjunction, how can I prove it ?}

Use some theorem or assumption or use the {\tt split} tactic.

\Question[disjonction]{My goal is a disjonction, how can I prove it ?}

You can prove the left part or the right part of the disjunction using {\tt left} or {\tt right} tactics. If you want to do a classical reasoning step, use {\tt }  to prove the right part with the assumption that the left part of the disjunction is false.

\Question[forall]{My goal is an universally quantified statement, how can I prove it ?}

Use some theorem or assumption or introduce the quantified variable in the context using the {\tt intro} tactic. If there are several variables you can use the {\tt intros} tactic. 

\Question[exist]{My goal is an existential, how can I prove it ?}

Use some theorem or assumption or exhibits the witness using {\tt exists} tactic.

\Question[taut]{My goal is a propositional tautology, how can I prove it ?}

Just use the {\tt tauto} tactic.

\Question[firstorder]{My goal is a first order formula, how can I prove it ?}

Just use the {\tt firstorder} tactic.

\Question[cong]{My goal is solvable by a sequence of rewrites, how can I prove it ?}

Just use the {\tt congruence} tactic.

\Question[congnot]{My goal is disequality solvable by a sequence of rewrites, how can I prove it ?}

For instance :

\Question[reflection]{What is a proof by reflection ?}

This is a proof generated by some computation which is done using the internal reduction of Coq (not using the tactic language of \Coq (\Ltac) nor the implementation language for \Coq).
An example of tactic using the reflection mechanism is the {\tt ring} tactic. 
The reflection method consist in reflecting a subset of Coq language (for example the arithmetical expressions) into an object of the Coq language itself (in our case an inductive type denoting arithmetical expressions).
For more information see  \cite{howe,harrison,boutin} and the last chapter of the CoqArt.

\section{\Ltac}

\Ltac is the tactic language for \Coq.

\Question[ltacerror]{Why do I always get the same error message ?}


\Question[ltacprint]{Is there any printing command in \Ltac ?}

You can use the {\tt Idtac} tactic with a string argument. Thsi string
will be printed out.
The same applies to the 
{\tt fail} tactic

\Question[letltac]{What is the syntax for let in \Ltac ?}

\Question[matchltac]{What is the syntax for pattern matching in \Ltac ?}

\Question[matchsem]{What is the semantic for match context ?}

\Question[statdyn]{How can I define static and dynamic code ?}


\section{Conclusion and Farewell.}
\label{ccl}

\Question[NoAns]{What if my question isn't answered here ?} 
\label{lastquestion}

Don't panic. You can try the \Coq manual~\cite{Coq:e} for a technical
description of the prover. The Coq'Art~\cite{Coq:coqart} is the first
book written on \Coq and provides a comprehensive review of the
theorem prover as well as a number of example and exercises. Finally,
the tutorial~\cite{Coq:Tutorial} provides a smooth introduction to
theorem proving in \Coq.

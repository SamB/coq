\begin{abstract}
This note intends to provide an easy way to get aquainted with the
\Coq theorem prover. It tries to formulate appropriate answers
to some of the questions any newcommers will face, and to give
pointers to other references when possible.

\section{Introduction}
This FAQ is the sum of the questions that came to mind as we developed
proofs in \Coq. Since we are singularly short-minded, we wrote the
answers we found on bits of papers to have them at hand whenever the
situation occurs again. This, is pretty much the result of that: a
collection of tips one can refer to when proofs become intricate. Yes,
this means we won't take the blame for the shortcomings of this
FAQ. But if you want to contribute and send in your own question and
answers, feel free to write to us\ldots

\section{Presentation}

\Question[whatiscoq]{What is \Coq ?} 
The Coq tool is a proof assistant which:
\begin{itemize}
\item allows to handle calculus assertions,
\item to check mechanically proofs of these assertions,
\item helps to find formal proofs,
\item extracts a certified program from the constructive proof of its formal specification, 
\end{itemize}
Coq is written in the Objective Caml language and uses the Camlp4 Pre-processor-pretty-printer for Objective Caml.

\Question[name]{Did you really need to name it like that ?}
Some french computer scientists have a tradition of naming their
software as animal species: Caml, Elan, Foc or Krakatoa are examples
of this tacit convention. In french, ``coq'' means rooster, and it
sounds like the initials of the Calculus of Constructions CoC on which
it is based.

\Question[theoremprovers]{What are the other theorem provers ?} 
Many other theorem provers are available for use nowadays. Isabelle /
HOL, Lego, Nuprl, PVS are examples of provers that are fairly similar
to \Coq by the way they interact with the user. More distant relatives of
\Coq are ACL2, ALF, Alfa, Mizar, $\Omega$mega\ldots

\Question[intuitionnisticlogic]{What is intuitionnistic logic ?}

\section{Documentation}

\Question[coqdocumentation]{Where can I find documentation about \Coq ?} 
All the documentation about \Coq, from the reference manual to
friendly tutorials and documentation of the standard library, is
available online at 
\mbox{\tt http://pauillac.inria.fr/coq/doc-eng.html}.
All these documents are viewable either in browsable html, or as
downloadable postscripts.

\Question[coqfaq]{Where can I find this faq on the web ?} 
Errr\ldots

\Question[coqmailinglist]{Is there any mailing list about \Coq ?} 
The main \Coq mailing list is {\tt coq-club@pauillac.inria.fr}, which
broadcasts questions and suggestions about the implementation, the
logical formalism or proof developments. See
\mbox{\tt http://pauillac.inria.fr/mailman/listinfo/coq-club} for
subsription. Bugs reports should be sent at the {\tt
coq-bugs@pauillac.inria.fr} mailing-list.

\Question[coqbook]{Is there any book about \Coq ?}
The first book on \Coq, Yves Bertot and Pierre Castéran's Coq'Art will
be published by Springer-Verlag in 2004:
\begin{quote}
``This book provides a pragmatic introduction to the development of
proofs and certified programs using Coq. With its large collection of
examples and exercises it is an invaluable tool for researchers,
students, and engineers interested in formal methods and the
development of zero-default software.''
\end{quote}

\section{Installation}

\Question[coqlicence]{What is the licence of \Coq ?}
It is distributed under the GNU Public Licence (GPL).

\Question[coqsources]{Where can I find the sources of \Coq ?}
The sources of \Coq can be found online in the tar.gz'ed packages
({\tt http://coq.inria.fr/distrib-eng.html}). Most recent sources can
be accessed via anonymous CVS: {\tt
http://coqcvs.inria.fr/cvsserver-eng.html}

\Question[platform]{On which platform \Coq is available ?}
Compiled binaries are available for Linux, MacOs X, Solaris, and
Windows.

\Question[nbusers]{How many \Coq users are there ?}

\Question[howold]{How old is \Coq ?}
The first official release of \Coq (v. 4.1.0) was distributed in 1989.

\Question[relatedtools]{What are the \Coq-related tools ?}

\section{Conclusion and Farewell.}
\label{ccl}

\Question[NoAns]{What if my question isn't answered here ?} 
\label{lastquestion}

Don't panic. You can try the \Coq manual~\cite{Coq:e} for a technical
description of the prover. The Coq'Art~\cite{Coq:coqart} is the first
book written on \Coq and provides a comprehensive review of the
theorem prover as well as a number of example and exercises. Finally,
the tutorial~\cite{Coq:Tutorial} provides a smooth introduction to
theorem proving in \Coq.

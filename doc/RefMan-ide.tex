The \Coq{} Integrated Development Environment is a graphical tool, to
be used as a user-friendly replacement to \texttt{coqtop}. Its main
purpose is to allow the user to navigate forward and backward into a
\Coq{} vernacular file, executing corresponding commands or undoing
them respectively. CREDITS ? Proof general, lablgtk, ...

\coqide{} is run by typing the command \verb|coqide| on the command
line. Without argument, the main screen is displayed with an ``unnamed
buffer'', and with a file name as argument, another buffer displaying
the contents of that file. Additionally, coqide accepts the same
options as coqtop, given in Chapter~\ref{Addoc-coqc}, the ones having
obviously no meaning for \coqide{} being ignored.

\coqide{} main screen is shown on Figure~\ref{fig:coqide}.  (Attention
il manque la toolbar sur cet ecran car je l'ai enleve par defaut) At
the top is a menu bar, the left window is displaying the various
buffers, the upper right window is the ``goal window'', where goals to
prove are displayed. The lower right window is the ``message window'',
where various messages resulting from commands are displayed. At the
bottom is the status bar.

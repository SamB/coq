INSTALLATION PROCEDURE FOR THE PRECOMPILED COQ V8.2 SYSTEM UNDER MACOS X
------------------------------------------------------------------------

You can also use fink, or the MacOS X package prepared by the Coq
team. To use the MacOS X package,:

1) Download archive coq-8.2-macosx-ppc.dmg (for PowerPC-base computer)
   or coq-8.2-macosx-i386.dmg (for Pentium-based computer).

2) Double-click on its icon; it mounts a disk volume named "Coq V8.2".

3) Open volume "Coq 8.2" and double-click on coq-8.2.pkg to launch the
   installer (you'll need administrator permissions).

4) Coq installs in /usr/local/bin, which should be in your PATH, and
   can be used from a Terminal window: the interactive toplevel is
   named coqtop and the compiler is coqc.

  The LogiCal team (ex-Coq team) is releasing a new version of Coq.
Its name is V7.0beta. This new version is still in debugging phase
and is provided for users willing to experiment the new features which
are:

  - a primitive let-in construct
  - qualified names (such as Logic.f_equal)
  - a new tactic language based on a mini functional language with higher-
    level pattern-matching constructs on goals (contributed by David Delahaye)
  - a new decision tactic for the real field (contributed by David Delahaye
    and Micaëla Mayero)
  - an improved Search facilities using patterns (contributed by Yves Bertot)
  - various bug fixes
  - new user contributions on ...
  - a module to export definitions, theorems and proofs to XML to be
    used with Bologna rendering tools (see http://www.cs.unibo.it/helm)

  Extraction and the Realizer/Program tactics are not available in Coq V7.0. 

  The internals of Coq have changed a lot. For the user, this shows
through new and located error messages, improved efficiency, safer
proof-checker. This justifies the new major version number 7.

  However, the internals of Coq will continue to change significantly
in the next months and we recommend tactic developers to take contact
with us for adapting their code.

  Coq V7.0beta is available as a source package from http://coq.inria.fr
and ftp://ftp.inria.fr/INRIA/coq/V7

  Please refer to the document CHANGES in the archive for a full list
of changes including sources of incompatibilities (very few).

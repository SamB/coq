The Coq development team is pleased to announce the release of Coq
version 7.4. 

  This version provides several novelties, including a new system of
parametric modules and interfaces, and support for the Why
(http://why.lri.fr) and Krakatoa (http://www.lri.fr/~marche/krakatoa)
systems. However, this version is still experimental and does not
fully support the functionalities of the previous version 7.3.1
(especially ast-based grammar extensions are off).

  Please refer to the accompanying document CHANGES or the location
ftp://ftp.inria.fr/INRIA/coq/V7.4/doc/Changes.html for a full list of
changes including sources of incompatibilities.

  Coq V7.4 is available in several formats from http://coq.inria.fr/
and ftp://ftp.inria.fr/INRIA/coq/V7.4/

  The documentation is available in postscript, pdf and html format.

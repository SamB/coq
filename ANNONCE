  Compared to version 7.0, the new version provides with

  - port of user contributions (including new libraries for
    constructive complex analysis, floating-point numbers, P-automaton
    and graph theory, and formalizations of the ABR algorithm, CTL and

    C language, imperative Bresenham line drawing algorithm, imperative
    Marché's minimal edition distance algorithm, Buchberger's algorithm,

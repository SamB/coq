  The Coq development team is pleased to announce the release of Coq
version 7.3. This release fixes most of version 7.2 known bugs (see
http://coq.inria.fr/bin/coq-bugs for the current status of reported
bugs) and offers the following novelties or improvements.

- New option -dump-glob to coqtop to dump globalizations (to be used by the 
  new documentation tool coqdoc; see http://www.lri.fr/~filliatr/coqdoc).
- Elimination to Set/Type from empty propositions and to Type from
  "singleton" propositions now allowed (as a consequence eqT_rec and
  False_rec are now automatically available).
- New tactic "Rename x into y" for renaming hypotheses.
- New tactics "Pose x:=u" and "Pose u" to add definitions to local context.
- Record's now accept anonymous fields "_" (no projection is built then)
- Haskell extraction now operational.
- Extensions of [ZArith]: Zcomplements.v, Zpower.v and Zlogarithms.v
  have been moved from contrib/omega to ZArith. They now include
  the Zsgn function, more induction principles (Wf_Z.v and
  tail of Zcomplements.v) and one more general Euclid theorem.

  Inversion has been improved and Intuition simplified but not in a fully
compatible way.

  Pcoq user interface (http://www-sop.inria.fr/lemme/pcoq) is not
ported to V7.3 yet.

  Coq V7.3 is available in several formats from http://coq.inria.fr
and ftp://ftp.inria.fr/INRIA/coq/V7.3. We currently provide the
following versions

  package for sources
  rpm package for sources
  rpm packages for linux
  binary package for Sun-Solaris
  binary version for Windows
  binary version for MacOS X (Darwin)

  The documentation is available in postscript, pdf and html format.

  Please refer to the accompanying document CHANGES or the location
ftp://ftp.inria.fr/INRIA/coq/V7.3/doc/Changes.html for a full list of
changes including sources of incompatibilities.

  Users are kindly invited to report bugs to coq-bugs@pauillac.inria.fr
and to mail Coq-Club@pauillac.inria.fr for general questions or remarks.

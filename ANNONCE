It is more than two years since the last release of Coq. We're glad
to now announce the beta release of Coq version 8.1.

The main features of Coq version 8.1 (beta) are

- the implementation of an auxiliary algorithm for checking the
  convertibility of types, specially dedicated to fast type-checking
  of reflexion-based proofs, and more generally to intensive
  computation

- inductive types

  - support for recursively non uniform parameters
  - support for a strong form of sort-polymorphism

- improved tactics

  - new implementation of setoid rewrite (contributed by C. Sacerdoti Coen)
  - new implementation of ring (contributed by B. Grégoire and A. Mahboubi)
  - and several other new tactic features (see attached file CHANGES)

- libraries
 
  - finite sets and finite maps (by J.-C. Filliâtre and P. Letouzey)
  - strings (by L. Théry)
  - significative extensions of the library on lists
  - some other extensions (see attached file CHANGES)
  - rational numbers (as a quotient over Z/Z+* -- an alternative
    library based on the canonical Stern-Brocot representation is
    available in the user contributions)

- experimental features

  - new command to generate proof obligations from definitions of
    programs required to meet their specification (see chapter 19 of
    the reference manual)

and many other features mentioned in the CHANGES file.

Most of known bugs have been fixed (see coq-bugs at coq.inria.fr for details).

Coq version 8.1 hopefully comes with only a few incompatibilities. One
purpose of this beta version is to estimate to which extent the final
version 8.1 may provide better support for compatibility.

Coq version 8.1 is based on new Coq version 8.0. Users migrating from
Coq version 7.x and older must first translate their developments from
the old syntax using the translator provided with Coq version 8.0.

\ocwsection \label{library}
This section describes the \Coq\ library, which is made of two parts:
\begin{itemize}
  \item a general mechanism to keep a trace of all operations and of
    the state of the system, with backtrack possibilities;
  \item a global environment for the CCI, with functions to export and 
    import compiled modules.
\end{itemize}
